## About

This is a simple Website that creates a color palette from a hex color similar to Tailwind's color palettes.
I created the page along my way of learning a bit about Tailwind CSS.

Consider the page a "work in progress", since I'm still fixing bugs and adding features (and cleaning up the code ðŸ™„).

You can find the Page here:
